my goal is to create a script which is running once a day and is using my laptop camera for making an image of me. my goal is it to put it later on github so that other people can easily set it up by themselve. ideally its supporting all sorts of operating system i.e. mac and windows. how can i accomplish that?

running the script as simple 


app which is doing every day an image of you and adds this image of you to an html page. some people want to make it public some dont, optionally there is a a github page upload thing opportunity

a macapp which is making a image of you every day. kinda fun. can make users make pay for that. kinda fun. love it. can do it in rust. finally i am learning rust. 



i want to build
